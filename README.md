# College Market

**College Market** is an open-source platform designed to connect students within a specific university, creating a stronger sense of community. Inspired by the communal spirit of a farmers market, it provides a space for students to buy and sell items, exchange course advice, and offer tutoring services.

## Features

- **Buying and selling items**: Students can post and browse items for sale, from textbooks to furniture.
- **Course advice**: A platform for students to give and receive advice on courses, professors, and academic life.
- **Tutoring services**: Students can offer or find tutoring services for various subjects.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular** for building the front-end
- **Docker** for deployment

## Why College Market is Important

College can be an isolating experience, especially for students looking for resources, advice, or affordable essentials. **College Market** bridges this gap by creating a **student-driven marketplace** where students can support one another—whether by **buying and selling items, sharing career advice, or offering tutoring services**.  

Designed with the **community spirit of a farmers market**, College Market fosters **connections, collaboration, and convenience** within a university. It not only makes student life more affordable but also strengthens the **campus network**, encouraging students to **engage, support, and succeed together**.
